## developer notes

### code locations for all actors that can hold items

The `$7F` value is set _after_ the code executes for the given item/weapon/whatever. 

| name                           | RAM  | ROM   | identifier | notes                          |
|--------------------------------|------|-------|------------|--------------------|
| merchant (weapon/item)         | |
| merchant (whip)                | EDF4 | 1EE04 | $7F is #33 (thorn), #34 (chain), or #35 (morning star) | ($40 AND #1F) - #7 = $434 |
| crystal dude (blue)            | 906F | 507F  | | $7F is 0x55 on accept, 0x6B on reject (text???) |
| crystal dude (red)             | 9088 | 5098  | | $7F is 0x56 on accept, 0x6B on reject (text???) |
| laurel dude (laruba)           | 9347 | 5357  | $7F = #78 | |
| flame whip dude                | 8C72 | 4C82  | $7F = #75 | | 
| diamond dude                   | AA3A | 6A4A  | $7F = #12 | |
| secret merchant (silver knife) | AE12 | 6E22  | $7F = #10 | |
| secret merchant (silk bag)     | AE07 | 6E17  | $7F = #0F | |
| orb                            | | | |
| Death                          | 87C7 | 47D7  | $3BA = #44 (#49 for knife) | still appears as knife no matter what item it actually gives you |
| Camilla                        | 87BF | 47CF  | $3BA = #42 (#?? for cross) | still appears as cross no matter what item it actually gives you |
| sacred flame                   | 87CD | 47DD | | |

### unused but interesting values

(ROM) 0x1EE25 is 0x090010, which seems to indicate it's a carryable item, but 0x10 doesn't match up with the bit flags currently mapped.

| carry item  | bit |
|-------------|-----|
| silk bag    | 1   |
| magic cross | 2   |
| laurels     | 3   |
| garlic      | 4   |

### progression logic decisions

* Whips will be upgraded progressively. No quick jump to morning star or flame whip.
* Crystals will also be encountered progressively to prevent potential super boring back tracking.
* The 3 block whip jump in Camilla's Cemetery is **NOT** in logic. This means red crystal is required for Bodley, Laruba, Doina, etc...
* Laurels are considered required for Laruba Mansion
* Laurels are **NOT** considered required to cross the swamp in Belasco Marsh

### dialog text

`0xCC84` is where all the text starts in the ROM. First one is "What a horrible night to have a curse".

| (end) | 0xFF |

### in lib/core.js

* **Dead River - Part 2** and **Dead River to Brahm** share the same actors, so this needs to be accounted for during any randomizing that involves the actors in those screens. Essentially, unless otherwise handles, **Dead River - Part 2** will take precedence since it is defined after **Dead River to Brahm** in the `core.js` definition file.
* `npc.crystalDude` is the same as the (secret) merchant in the non-town pattern tables

### pattern table re-mapping

I had to store new 1 byte values (high 4 bits are bg table, low 4 bits are sprite table) for every screen in the game. These needed to stored in a space that could be accessed mathematically based on 3 values: objset ($30), area ($50), and submap ($51 AND #$0xF). Those 3 values together compose a unique reference to every screen. The table below shows how I allocated free bytes in the ROM to essentially store a multi-dimensional array. 

| objset | # of areas | # of submaps | map storage |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0x00   | 24         | 2            | 48          |
| 0x01   | 11         | 4            | 44          |
| 0x02   | 10         | 4            | 40          |
| 0x03   | 5          | 5            | 25          |
| 0x04   | 4          | 2            | 8           |
| 0x05   | 1          | 2            | 2           |


So I'm mapping 167 bytes, only using 93 of those bytes in total, thereby wasting 74 bytes as unused space between the valid values of the mult-dimensional array. The pseduo-code calculation below shows roughly how, stored in this manner, I can access any bg/sprite table index at any time with the objset, area, and submap values:

```
// OBJ_OFFSET is 0x30, as there's equal space between each objset in the stored bytes.
(objset * OBJ_OFFSET) + (area * num_of_submaps_for_this_area) + submap
```

With the values stored, we then hijack the typical rudimentary pattern table mapping code. We write to unused ROM space at `0x7860` the compiled opcodes of the 6502 asm contained in the file at `data/pattern.asm`. This code is responsible for executing the calculation above and then properly selecting a sprite table index based on it. All we need to do after that is overwrite 3 particular bytes of code to point to our new code. Essentially we replace the code at `0x1CCDF` with the following:

```
JSR $B850: 20 50 B8
```

and voila! Each screen now has it's own pattern table mapping! Here's the original mapping, which shows there were only 6 options (instead of the 93 possible options we have now). Here we can see what background and sprite table indexes correspond to what enemy groupings.


objset | pattern pointers | bg   | sprite | name 
-------|------------------|------|--------|--------
0      | 0x1CCF9          | 0x00 | 0x01   | town
1      | 0x1CCFB          | 0x08 | 0x09   | mansion
2      | 0x1CCFD          | 0x02 | 0x03   | woods 1
3      | 0x1CCFF          | 0x04 | 0x05   | woods 2
4      | 0x1CD01          | 0x06 | 0x07   | graveyard
5      | 0x1CD03          | 0x0B | 0x0C   | castlevania

### merchant shuffle

// merchant purchasable items: 0x1ee22-0x1ee39

// code for blue crystal guy at 1:906F(RAM) 0x507F(ROM)

// code for red crystal guy at 1:9088(RAM) 0x5098(ROM)

// 07:C08A function for red crystal


// F7 is dpad
