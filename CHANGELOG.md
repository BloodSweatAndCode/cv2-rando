## 0.0.19 - 2019-08-14

* All references and files named `cv2-rando` or `cv2rando` have been changed to `cv2r`, including the repo name. I have saved the `cv2rando` binary for now, but it will be removed in 0.1.0.
* Made `npm test` work on Windows in a [cmder](https://cmder.net/) prompt. Still doesn't work in default Windows command line.

## 0.0.18 - 2019-08-12

* Don't output spoiler csv file when `--json` is used
* update `package.json` to use the bin name `cv2rando`

## 0.0.17 - 2019-08-11

* Fixed title screen bug
* Added ability to have the `cv2rando` process dump the generated rom patch to stdout. This is used by the [cv2r.com](http://cv2r.com) website, but can also be used by anyone who wants access to the patch file generated by the `cv2rando` process.

## 0.0.16 - 2019-08-06

* cv2-rando is now fully patch-driven, including what was internal code like itemizer, enemizer, shared assembly subroutines like clear-objects, etc...
* Added `-d, --difficulty` option for making reasonable groups of patches based on difficulty. For now the options are `easy`, `standard`, and `hard`. `standard` is the default setting.
* Added `-p, --palette` option to allow explicitly picking palettes. Palettes are structured and behave like any other patch but have their own folder at `lib/palette` to keep them all together. By default the palette will be the original Simon's Quest palette.
* Cleaner `--debug` output

## 0.0.15 - 2019-07-27

* Added crc32 sum of the seed to the title screen
* Moved jovah warp, inventory deselect, and SRAM clearing out of itemizer and into core code

## 0.0.14 - 2019-07-27

* Automated testing added
* ROMs are now generated to the `roms` folder by default, not the `tmp` folder

## 0.0.13 - 2019-07-25

* Allow deselecting quest items by pressing B button in inventory
